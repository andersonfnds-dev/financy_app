# NuFinance - A Nubank clone concept with Flutter & Firebase

The **NuFinance** Application is an attempt to clone the Nubank's app interface while acting as a **simple finance control tool**. The user can set its monthly budget and add new expenses to consume it. All the backend is on top of Firebase Firestore, and we use the Authentication module to register/login the user. Also, we trigger a **Cloud Function** every time a document is created into the Firestore to sum the total expenses amount.
